# React String Table
I created this string variation table [previously](https://github.com/tannercd/stringtable-web) using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Now this repository holds the converted React project. 

I enjoyed learning the fundamentals of React on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org), so I thought why not practice my React skills by converting a previous project entirely to React! I also became familiar with deploying my production build React App to Netlify.

## Getting Started
View the React string table app in action at: **https://reactstrtable.netlify.app**

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
