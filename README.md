This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React String Table
I created this string variation table originally with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Now this repository holds the converted React project. I was enjoying learning the fundamentals on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org) so I thought why not practice my React skills by converting a previous project entirely to React.

## Getting Started
View the React string table app in action at: **https://reactstrtable.netlify.app**

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
