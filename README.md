## React String Table
I created this string variation table originally with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Now this repository holds the converted React project. I was enjoying learning the fundamentals on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org) so I thought why not practice my React skills by converting a previous project entirely to React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
